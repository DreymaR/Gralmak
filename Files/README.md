## Gralmak Files
In these folders are various files that may be used to implement the Gralmak(S) layout.
- Keep in mind that my [EPKL][PKL-Git] program for Windows contains [Gralmak][Gmk-PKL] plus ergo mods.
<br>

The [Kanata][Kanata] files are for the multiplatform key remapper of that name. See its folder readme for more info.
- There are separate files for ANSI and ISO. Within these files, uncomment the variant you want.
<br>

The [MSKLC][MSKLCmdc] files can be used to create installable Windows system layouts. See my [MSKLC folder in EPKL][KLC-PKL] for info.
- There are files for plain Gralmak, the GralmakS sym modded variant, and Gralmak-AWS (both ISO and ANSI versions).
<br>

Aldo39's [Keyboard Layout File Creator (KLFC)][AldoKLFC] uses JSON layout definition files to create keyboard layouts.
<br>

Some JSON files were also made for the [MonkeyType][MonkyTyp] typing trainer:
- [Gralmak.json](./MonkeyType/Gralmak.json) is the base Gralmak layout without any mods.
- [GralmakS.json](./MonkeyType/GralmakS.json) is the GralmakS symbol-modded layout, with AltGr.
<br>

The [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)][U-CLDR] is a project that seeks to provide resources for language support. 
- It has a XML data format that's used by among others the Keybr learning site.
