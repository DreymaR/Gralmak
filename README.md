## The Gralmak keyboard layout
Gralmak is a Graphite-Gallium variant that keeps closer to familiar layouts without sacrificing significant quality.
<br><br>

## Work-In-Progress
- For now, there isn't much in this repo. Please consult the [Gralmak layout folder][GralEP] in my [EPKL][PKLGit] program for info.
- There are a few downloads ready in the Files folder though. More to come, fairly soon I hope.
